# Japan Iceberg: exploring the top and bottom of a culture
A culture is like an iceberg: both have a small visible part and a part hidden under the water. Using the five senses, we can perceive the top of the cultural iceberg, identifying the elements of the culture like language, rituals, and food. Japan's principal language is Japanese "Nihongo" (there are others like Ryukyuan languages) [1]. If you visit Japan, you will notice that Japanese people is don't wear shoes inside some buildings. In temples, some restaurants, and homes, there is a space called "genkan" [3]. In this space, you must (in a show of good manners) take off your shoes [3]. The Japanese cuisine includes white rice, soy products, seafood, and vegetables [2]. Moving to the bottom of the cultural iceberg, we can identify the belief and ideals of culture [1]. In Japanese models is accepted the hierarchical distinction in different aspects of society [2, 4]. There's also a strong presence of collectivism and competitiveness [4]. Because these two characteristics (collectivism and competitiveness) occur simultaneously, the concept of competition between groups and not people is created [4].
