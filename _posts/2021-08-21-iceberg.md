# Japan Iceberg: exploring the top and bottom of a culture
A culture is like an iceberg: both have a small visible part and a part hidden under the water. Using the five senses, we can perceive the top of the cultural iceberg, identifying the elements of the culture like rituals, food, and religion. To move from to top to the bottom of the iceberg, we use the language as a bridge. Using this bridge, we can understand the belief, ideals, norms, and roles at the bottom of the iceberg. In this post, we're going to explore the top and bottom of Japan's culture.

## The top of the iceberg
- Japan's principal language is Japanese (there are others like Ryukyuan languages).
- Japanese people don't wear shoes inside the home.
- In Japanese gastronomy, it is common to found seafood and vegetables.

## The bottom of the iceberg
- It is accepted the hierarchical distinction in different aspects of society.
- Japanese people see themselves as a short moment of history.
- Japan has collective competition (between groups, not individuals).
