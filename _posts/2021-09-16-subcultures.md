# Subculture: the otaku nation
The otaku subculture, describe by Tsutsui (2008, is formed by "the notoriously obsessive fans of manga, anime, video games, and other forms of Japanese popular culture." The otaku subculture is one of the many sub-cultures that have appeared in Japan since World War II. Even when manga and anime are important for Japanese culture and history [1, 2], an otaku is identified for knowing all the details of a product [1]. Otakus is a huge phenomenon, not just a group of people. There is a large population of otakus in both Japan and the other world [2]. Nevertheless, otaku can be perceived as perverts or even pedophiles [1].
