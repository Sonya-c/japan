# Colombia and Japan: comparing two cultures through the Hofstede model

Colombia and Japan are geographically distant; that's why they have multiple differences and, nevertheless, similarities. Both countries are collectivistic and have a high score in power distance (Colombia: 67, Japan: 54); This suggests that their nature unveils a hierarchical/class distinction. They also have a high score in masculinity (Colombia: 64, Japan: 95). But, while Japan's competitiveness focuses on groups, Colombia's approach is between social classes. These countries tend to avoid uncertainty (Colombia: 80, Japan: 92). However, they differ in their Long-term orientation (Colombia: 13, Japan: 88). On one side, Japanese people see themselves as a short moment of history. Therefore they must work for the future. On the other, Colombia has a low long-term orientation, investing its strength in protecting traditions instead of building the future.
