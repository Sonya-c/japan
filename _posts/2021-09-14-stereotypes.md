# Stereotypes: the danger of a single story
When I was a kid, one of the mains forms of information was television; this media didn't portray a good image of "China" In the first place, "they all are Chinese" was a common way of thinking. That's why Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, and other Asia countries fall into a bunch of stereotypes caused by ignorance. I couldn't avoid believing in them. But then, the internet joined the game. This tool allowed me to "meet" the culture through an experience of people and reading about their history, stories, mangas, and watching their movies. Japan's history, customs, and art are specialing fascinating and immersive. Writing this blog, I get to know more about the top and bottom of these iceberg called Japan.
